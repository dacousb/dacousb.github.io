        <p>Hi! My nick is dacousb and I am a developer. I've worked on several projects, here it is a chart with
            my skills.</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Programming language / Paradigm</th>
                <th>Skills</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Linux / Unix</td>
                <td>I have worked a lot with Linux. My skills include: general system management, knowledge of
                    general commands and useful operating system utilities, ease of getting used to new
                    Unix-like terminal applications and distributions, and experience with development
                    environments. Some of the best distros are: <ul>
                        <li>Void Linux</li>
                        <li>Linux Mint</li>
                        <li>FreeBSD (not Linux)</li>
                    </ul>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Python</td>
                <td>I've worked with Python at times. I have some experience with databases and web servers with
                    Python, and a lot of experience with the programming language as such, and I can quickly
                    learn the frameworks I need. I understand and have control over: classes, general variables,
                    functions and data types.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>C</td>
                <td>C is something I am meh at. I understand the basic concepts and I am able to develop simple
                    yet interesting programs, but some APIs of the system are complicated for me. With C I have
                    developed terminal programs (mini programming languages and shells) and general purpose
                    applications.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Web development</td>
                <td>In general, I'm pretty good at it, however, I love pages that have a design similar to those
                    of the 90's and 2000's, and that's why some of my designs can look very simple. I have
                    experience with HTML, JS and CSS, as well as non-dynamic pages with Python and Node.js
                    backend.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Rust</td>
                <td>I have designed small programs with Rust, some better than others. Anyway, I have experience
                    with: small networking systems, interaction with the operating system and general design of
                    terminal applications.</td>

        <p>Some of them are not very professional considering that I haven't even made
            it to college yet (but there's not much left huh).</p>
